Hello! 
I am a final-year dual degree student in Mechanical Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), India. I am excited about research in robotics focused on the control and motion planning of autonomous systems in complex and uncertain environments. I have been working with Prof. [Ashish Hota](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~ahota/), for my thesis on data-driven model predictive control for risk-aware behavior. More about my previous [research](/publications) and [projects](/projects)! 

<!-- <a href="/assets/pdf/web-cv.pdf"><i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i> curriculum vitae</a> -->

I will be joining [Intelligent Robotics and Autonomy Lab (iRaL)](https://vasileiostzoumas.com/students/) at [University of Michigan](https://www.engin.umich.edu/) in Ann Arbor to pursue doctoral studies, under the supervision of [Prof. Vasileios Tzoumas](https://vasileiostzoumas.com/) from Fall 2023. I aspire to work in the intersection of **controls**, **optimization**, and **learning** for safe navigation and control for robotics applications.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
